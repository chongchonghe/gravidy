# GraviDy -  Gravitational Dynamics

Check the original README in the master branch, or the original repo (https://github.com/cmaureir/gravidy).

## About

**GraviDy** is a new GPU, direct-summation N-body integrator written from scratch and based on the
Hermite scheme. The most important features of the code are:

 * Written in C/C++,
 * Using parallel computing techniques and libraries like OpenMP, MPI and CUDA,
 * full double-precision resolution,
 * its high modularity, which allows users to readily introduce new physics into it,
 * the exploitation of all high-performance computing resources available,
 * its maintenance and improvement cycle,
 * the fact that the code is publicly released under a BSD license and will be maintained via planned, public, regular updates.

## How to compile?

First, clone the repositotry

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chongchonghe/gravidy
cd gravidy/src
```

Then, depending on the OS you are on, 

- On UMD Astronomy machines, the default g++ is version 8, which is outdated. Version 11 is available in PATH as g++11

```sh
make CXX="g++11"
```

The original version of Gravidy use Boost library to do command parsing. I rewrote that part using pure C++ and removed this dependency, so the code does not rely on any library. If you want to use the original version with Boost, pass `use_boost=1` as an argument to make.

- On macOS, use your latest version of g++ isntalled via homebrew. The default g++, or Apple clang, does not support omp. The Boost library failed on macOS, so Makefile automatically set use_boost to 0 on Mac. 

```sh
make CXX="g++-13"
```

- On Zaratan

CPU (with OpenMP):

```sh
module load gcc/11.3.0
# module load boost/1.79.0
make
```

To use Boost command parsing, uncomment the line that loads boost, and pass `use_boost=1` as an argument to make.

MPI: Be sure to run `make distclean` before recompiling if you changed your module version or modified Makefile.

```sh
module load gcc/11.3.0
module load openmpi/4.1.4
# module load boost/1.79.0
make mpi
```

CUDA: failed. I couldn't make it work. Let me know if you can.

```sh
module load gcc/8.4.0
module load cuda/10.2.89
# module load boost/1.72.0
make gpu
```

- On Nvidia Cluster (for Hackathon)

```bash
module load gcc/11.2.0
make cpu
module load openmpi/gcc/64/4.1.2
make mpi
module unload openmpi/gcc/64/4.1.2
module load cuda-11.7.1
module load cuda11.7/toolkit/11.7.1
# module load nvhpc-23.3-nompi
make gpu
```

To run the test
```bash
module load conda
conda create -n gravidy python=3.9
conda activate gravidy
conda init bash
exec bash
module load conda
conda activate gravidy
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
bash test2.bash
```
